## Filecoin Foundation Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses Next's newer [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

## Running the project locally

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`, we use `npm` as our package manager.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
